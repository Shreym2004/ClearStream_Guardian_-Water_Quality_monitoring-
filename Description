The Clear Stream Guardian is an IoT-based water quality monitoring system built on the ESP32 microcontroller. It is designed to measure and track key water parameters in real time, making it suitable for environmental monitoring, aquaculture, research, and educational projects. The system integrates multiple sensors, including a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor, pH probe, TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) sensor, and a turbidity sensor, providing a comprehensive overview of water conditions.
The ESP32 reads analog and digital values from the sensors, processes them, and displays the results on a compact 0.96-inch OLED display for immediate visualization. The device operates on a 5-second update cycle, ensuring timely and reliable readings without overloading the hardware. Additionally, the project includes optional support for Blynk IoT integration, allowing sensor data to be uploaded to the cloud and viewed remotely through a mobile app. This feature enables continuous monitoring and alerts, making the system highly versatile and scalable.
One of the core aspects of the project is sensor calibration. pH, TDS, and turbidity sensors require proper calibration using standard reference solutions to ensure accuracy. Dedicated calibration sketches are provided to simplify this process. Once calibrated, the system can output precise values for pH levels, dissolved solids (in ppm), and turbidity (in NTU), alongside water temperature in Celsius.
From a hardware perspective, the project emphasizes accessibility and modularity. All sensors connect to specific GPIO pins on the ESP32, and the OLED communicates via the I²C protocol. Power management considerations are included to ensure sensor compatibility with the ESP32’s 3.3V ADC input.
Overall, the Clear Stream Guardian demonstrates how low-cost components and open-source software can be combined to build an effective, portable, and customizable water quality monitoring solution.
